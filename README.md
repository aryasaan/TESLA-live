# Tesla Clone
Welcome to the Tesla Clone project! This is a web application built using React.js, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The project aims to replicate the look and feel of the official Tesla website, showcasing various Tesla models, features, and functionalities.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

## Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
HTML: Markup language for structuring the web pages
CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the web pages
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
